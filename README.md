# What-to-cook

## App producing recommendations for cooking recipes based on available ingredients


Within the corona pandemie most of us have been challenged with the problem of having to cook our own meals based on what we find in our fridge at the very moment. 

In situations like this, an app that goes beyond the standard cooking books - suggesting meals for which we do not have the ingredients â€“ would make our lifes easier. 

The goal of our **What-to-cook** app is to present the user recommendations of recipies based on the ingredients at hand and the time one is willing to spend on cooking. 

The recommendations are ordered by the ratings of many users and can be filtered by various additional topics.
